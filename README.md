## Evil Hangman ##

#About#
Normally, in the game of Hangman, the computer picks a single word and accurately represents it as the human player tries to guess all of the letters in the word. In Evil Hangman, the computer instead maintains a list of every word in the English language, then continuously pares down the word list to try to dodge the player's guesses as much as possible. 

#Debug mode#
Set DEBUG_MODE = 1 to display the remaining possible word choices.
